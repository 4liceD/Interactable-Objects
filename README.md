# Interactable-Objects-NonNetworked
methods of interaction for VRChat worlds. Small edit to fit personal preferences. All credits go to swivel.
Parameters that are supposed to be executed only locally have been privatised to avoid malicious abuse.

New prefabs:

_Mirrors:
Please use this one instead of the regular Mirrors prefab

_Settings:
Makes use of an edge case in the mirror manager to make it use for world toggles instead.
